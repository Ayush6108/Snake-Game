# Snake-Game
The classic Snake Game is a popular and simple game often created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a fun beginner project.
Game Overview
In the Snake Game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. The objective is to collect food items that appear randomly on the grid. As the snake eats the food, it grows longer, making it more challenging to avoid collisions with itself or the walls. The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or its own body.
Structure Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
HTML:
Sets up the structure of the game, typically using a simple <canvas> element.
The <canvas> provides a space where the game's graphics are drawn dynamically using JavaScript.
CSS:
Styles the canvas and possibly adds some basic design elements, like centering the game on the page.
The styling is usually minimal, as most visual elements are handled by JavaScript on the canvas.
JavaScript:
Contains the main game logic, including movement, collision detection, and food generation.
The snake's position is updated based on key inputs (e.g., arrow keys).
The game loop repeatedly updates the game's state and redraws the snake and food on the canvas.
